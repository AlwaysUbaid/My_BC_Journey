# My Blockchain Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning blockchain development from scratch. It serves as a central hub to track my progress and connect to my various learning projects.

## About

I'm just starting my blockchain development journey. This repo will grow as I learn and build more projects. My goal is to document everything I learn about:

- Smart contract development
- Blockchain fundamentals
- Decentralized applications
- Web3 technologies

## Learning Repositories

These are the technologies I'm planning to learn:

- [Solidity-Learning](https://github.com/AlwaysUbaid/Solidity-Learning) - Smart contracts for Ethereum
- [Rust-Learning](https://github.com/AlwaysUbaid/Rust-Learning) - For blockchain infrastructure
- [Circom-Learning](https://github.com/AlwaysUbaid/Circom-Learning) - Zero-knowledge proofs
- [Web3-Frontend](https://github.com/AlwaysUbaid/Web3-Frontend) - Connecting frontends to blockchain

## Current Focus

Right now I'm focusing on:
1. Understanding blockchain fundamentals
2. Learning Solidity basics
3. Setting up my development environment

## Resources I'm Using

- Ethereum Documentation
- CryptoZombies
- YouTube tutorials
